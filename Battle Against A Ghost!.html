                How does one fight in an area where you can’t even get stable footing?! 
                The Under-dimension is a place where gravity and all the rules of the world are flipped on its head. 
                Islands float in the purple sky, water flows upwards, and the citizens are ghosts, demons, and other creepy 
                things that go “Oops, my bad!” in the middle of the night.
            </p>
            <p>
                Zhaoyang, unfortunately, fell in love with one of these entities after she tricked him, and now they faced 
                the possibility of Zhaoyang getting married at the young age of 17! Cordelia Hell, an obsessive ghost who yearns 
                to be forever bonded to Zhaoyang, has him captured, and it's up to Electra and the rest of the gang to save him!
            </p>
            <p>
                “Okay, we have basically opened a portal to hell? I think? Oh my god, there’s no time for philosophy when we 
                have to rescue Zhao!” Laila frantically panicked as she tried to comprehend what was going on. Only hours before, 
                she didn’t believe in ghosts and thought Zhaoyang was being silly when he described his daily circumstances, but 
                he was telling the truth this whole time.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Don’t worry Laila, baby! I got this!” Electra took a good look at Cordelia down below, who was about to read her vows.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Do you, Cordelia, take Zhaoyang to be husband FOR ETERNITY?! In life and in death?” A little fireball with glasses 
                read from a book.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I certainly do!” Cordelia sweetly said as she tightened the spirit chains around Zhaoyang.
            </p>
            <p>
                “And do you, Zhaoyang, take Cordelia as your wife who will constantly haunt you?” 
            </p>
            <p>
                “I-” Zhaoyang stuttered. 
            </p>
            <p>
                “HE DOESN’T!” Electra objected.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Well, well, well! If it isn’t the hunk of junk?” Cordelia said as she burned away her wedding dress and revealed 
                her true ghost form. “Trying to take my MAN away from me, huh?!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Oh please, this wedding is a sham! Getting married? After a week? This isn’t Vegas!” Electra retorted, then 
                immediately turning to Laila, “Hey was that cool or what? Still trying to work on my badass action hero lines.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Fine! If you wanna dance, let’s dance!” Cordelia immediately flew into the air and detached her limbs in a blaze 
                of purple glory.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Alright! Here goes nothing!” Electra jumped into the void, ready to face Cordelia on the island below. However, in 
                this world, instead of falling like normal, Electra started floating into the air. As if she was in outer space, she 
                was falling slightly but immediately lost any sense of balance.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Haha! Not like your normal human gravity, huh?!” Cordelia appeared right in front of Electra, ready to give her a 
                total interdimensional beatdown.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I don’t care if you’re a ghost and if I’m floating like a balloon, I’m still gonna kick your ass!” Electra pointed 
                her gun and steadied her aim. The battle against a ghost had begun!

                “<strong>Battle Against a Ghost</strong>” shows off a high-stakes battle between Electra and her adversary, Cordelia Helenne. This piece is meant to show off one of the key moments throughout Electra’s life where she had to save Zhaoyang from getting married to a demon, and her first time fighting such an odd entity. 
                <br>
                She’s never had to do anything like this, especially in a palace with inconsistent gravity. Overall, the craziness of the piece in every corner one looks is meant to show off how strange everything is, and it’s meant to capture an important scene in Electra’s life.
