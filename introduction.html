            <p>I guess I should introduce myself before you dig into my brain, huh?<br>

            My name is Electra Heart. File and .exe name are EH042712v3.<br>
            I’m an artificial intelligence created by Laila Babbage. <br>
            Within this easily accessible HTML website, you can find details about all my friends and some memories that are important to me.<br><br><br>

     Okay, now I’m done talking like a fucking robot. I know I am one, but come on, it’s so boring!<br>
    Anyways, first, you gotta meet the people who are important in my life before you access any of my wickedly awesome memories.
