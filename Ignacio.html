                Ugh, I love this kid. I had no idea he was in mathletes when I met him, but he told me he was and that he was 
                a friend of Laila! I was like, ‘Dude that’s sick!’
            </p>

                I met him on Christmas Day alone on an icy bridge. He kept staring down into the water below and I’ll admit, 
                he looked really bummed. Not like, dropped his ice cream bummed, but like, extremely extremely bummed. 
                So I asked him what he was doing, he told me nothing, and then I said that he should join our Christmas party at home! 
                From then, he kinda became part of the group.

                He’s very unsure of himself and so incredibly well…not confident. But we’re working on it! 
                He entered this dance competition and he SLAYED! He didn’t win, but the experience was still valuable and I can 
                tell he gained a little more confidence. He’s like, INSANELY good at fire magic too! Dodona’s been training him, 
                and I think that’ll definitely do him some good.
