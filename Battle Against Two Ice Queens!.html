                Who knew a dancing tournament that Ignacio decided to participate in randomly would end up with the whole city 
                completely frozen over? Judah Borne, a zealous man with ambitions of being the best performer in the whole world, 
                summoned a giant ice queen spirit to freeze the whole city after he placed last in the dance tournament. 
                Everyone was completely frozen in ice, save for Ignacio and Electra.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Electra!? What do we do? I have NO IDEA how to save these people!” Ignacio stammered. Right before the incident, 
                he was unfortunately lost in the semi-finals after getting inside his head again, 
                and as Electra was comforting him backstage, the whole town froze over.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Look, we need to take down that gay ice man AND his weird Ice Spirit! There must be something we can do…” 
                Electra began going through multiple databases in her mind to figure out what the best course of action was, 
                but admittedly, she was drawing a blank. Suddenly, Ignacio had a spark of inspiration.
            </p>
            <p>
                “What if we give him the show he wants?” Ignacio asked. “Look, he’s kind of full of himself and wants to give 
                a great performance. What if I challenged him to a dance battle?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Electra’s eyes widened. 
                “What if I also put on a show? I mean, with the whole town being frozen over now, I’ve always wanted to 
                try ice skating…THAT’S IT! Okay, while Judah is busy dancing against you, I’m gonna fight that giant ice 
                queen thing. Laila’s got a flamethrower back home, and I can quickly download the ice-skating ability.”
            </p>
            <p>
                After some preparation, the two were ready to face off against the two ice queens. Ignacio headed 
                towards the main stage and raised his hand, challenging Judah to a dance battle. If Ignacio wins, 
                Judah must unfreeze everyone. If Judah wins, then Ignacio and Electra would both be frozen, and 
                Judah would be the best dancer by default. Judah accepted on the condition that they would dance to “Judas” by Lady Gaga. 
                Ignacio graciously accepted as that was his favorite song to dance to.
            </p>
            <p>
                Immediately, Electra and Ignacio were off. Electra readied her ice skates and immediately began rushing toward 
                the giant ice queen. Ignacio and Judah showed off their fabulous moves, both incredibly in sync with one another. 
                However, in the middle of the song, Judah plays a dirty trick and freezes Ignacio’s feet, immobilizing him. 
                Electra notices and unfortunately loses her balance, causing the ice queen to get the upper hand in the fight. 
                Judah then completely freezes Ignacio in ice.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, inside of Ignacio, a spark emerges. A spark of flame that melts the ice away and shines brighter than anything 
                that’s ever shown before. In the ice, Ignacio had time to think and realize his true potential. With his newfound ability 
                to summon fire, he immediately lights up and unfreezes everyone! It’s now time to finish what they started, and now Electra 
                and Ignacio have the upper hand!

                “<strong>Battle Against Two Ice Queens</strong>” represents the climactic moment in Electric Heart’s second major arc. Ignacio (foreground-left) summons fire against Judah Borne’s (foreground-right) powerful ice spells! Here, Electra is in the background fighting a large Ice Queen-like monster with a flamethrower. 
                <br>
                Ignacio is at the forefront and taking center stage, showing how in Electra’s memory this was about Ignacio and his big moment rather than herself. Her friends are what matter greatly to her, and their memories and happiness matter just as much as her own.
