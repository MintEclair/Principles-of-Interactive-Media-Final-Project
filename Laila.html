                She’s a shy and bashful little thing. Oh! Did I mention she’s probably the smartest girl in the world? 
                Girl could whip up ANYTHING and it’s awesome. One time, she made a salt gun. What does it do? Well, it shoots salt. 
                Yeah, I think she was going through an identity crisis when she made it, but it was still super useful. 
                Did you know ghosts hate salt? Fancy that.

                Anyway, she’s super smart and all that yada yada. Unfortunately, she has problems regulating her emotions and 
                just between me and whoever is hacking my brain right now, I think she’s a bit of a control freak. But she’s 
                basically like my sister…mom? A god-like figure? I don’t know what she is in relation to me, but she’s one of my 
                bestest friends!
