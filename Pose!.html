                “I’m ready for my closeup!” shouted Electra as she self-groomed and made sure she had everything she needed 
                for the photoshoot. In the meantime, she tried out some cool action poses that she thought would make her look cool. 
                She looked down at the gun she brought with her and immediately used her robot powers to look up cool action movie 
                posters.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Well actually this is going to be more of a medium close-up picture, but I like the spirit!” 
                Laila stated as she set up the camera. Today was a huge day for Laila, after all. Electra Heart as a 
                robot creation was finally complete. When a creator makes something magnificent, of course, they would 
                want a photo with it.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Hey, why am I here again?” Zhaoyang asked, darting his eyes around like he was looking for something 
                to jump out at him.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Because you’re my friend, and I want to show the world that I am not only super smart, but I 
                also have friends!” Laila responded.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Aw, thanks, Laila!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Wait am I your friend still?” Electra asked, pausing her action posing.
            </p>
            <p>
                “You’re not only my friend but my magnificent creation! Now, I could only afford one roll of fancy old-timey film. 
                So we REALLY have to make this count!” Laila finally put everything together and was ready to take the perfect 
                photograph. “Okay everyone, let’s get together and stand very still!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Standing still? But I wanna look cool!” Electra whined.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Okay, Zhaoyang and I will sit still, and uh…you can do your own thing, Electra! Just please keep it appropriate.” 
                With that passive permission, Electra turned her back to the camera, lifted her gun in the air with one hand, and 
                gave a thumbs-up with the other.
            </p>
            <p>
                “This one harkens back to a classic!” Electra exclaimed.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Uhh, sure!” Laila smiled, hiding nervousness in her voice. “Alright everyone, let’s go ahead and get this over 
                with…” Laila pressed the clicker and the camera’s timer started ticking down.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Okay, guess I can finally relax for a minute. I don’t think anything will jump out,” Zhaoyang sighed in relief.
            </p>
            <p>
                “SURPRISE! DIDN’T THINK YOUR FAVORITE GHOST COULDN’T FIND YA?!” Immediately, Kyle, the Green Ghost, 
                appeared right behind Zhaoyang.
            </p>
            <p>
                “AH-dude what the hell?? This is supposed to be a NICE PHOTO HOW COULD YOU-” 
            </p>
            <p>
                *Click!* 
            </p>
            <p>
                Even though everything in this photo went wrong, or wasn’t up to Laila’s expectations, 
                Electra still fondly remembers her first photoshoot. In her mind, it’s the cover of her story about her 
                wickedly awesome life.

                    This cover for the story of <strong>Electric Heart</strong> is intended not only to show off the initial three main characters, but also their different personalities as well. 
                    <br> 
                    <strong>Electra</strong> (center) is a little boisterous, <strong>Laila</strong> (right) feels overshadowed by her creation and is an incredibly cautious person, and <strong>Zhaoyang</strong> (left) constantly gets harassed by ghosts and other evil entities. 
                    <br>
                    This work is also meant to reflect the first issue of Astro Boy in composition and posing. It represents Electra’s first memories of her with her friends through the lens of a beginning comic book.
