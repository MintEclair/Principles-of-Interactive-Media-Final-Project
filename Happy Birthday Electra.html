                On this day, one year ago, Laila flipped a switch and thus, Electra Heart came into existence! 
                Laila was just chilling in her lab one day when she noticed in her Snapstafacegram memories that she brought 
                Electra to life one year ago. She told Electra the good news that it was her birthday!
            </p>
            <p>
                At first, Electra was unsure. Over the past year, she had to wrestle with the idea of whether or 
                not she even should be considered human. While she has made friends, fallen in love, and learned a lot 
                about who she is, deep down she never felt like she fully belonged. Maybe it’s because she doesn’t have blood, 
                or she wasn’t born like a regular person, or she didn’t feel unsettled by anything ever. Even though everyone 
                in her life treated her like a person, she still felt like she didn’t deserve it.
            </p>
            <p>
                “You sure? I mean, I wasn’t even born per se…” Electra admitted when Laila told her the good news.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Who cares if you weren’t born? I mean, you still came into existence one year ago! Meaning you’ve been on this 
                planet for one full solar cycle and that’s worth celebrating!” Laila retorted back.
            </p>
            <p>
                Electra still wasn’t sure.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Okay, if this is what matters to you, I guess you can throw me a birthday party.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Laila cheered and then kicked Electra out of the house so she could set up. Laila did her best to make sure 
                everything was perfect on short notice. She could only get a basic Happy Birthday banner, some balloons, and a 
                clown that said he was a friendly clown! Laila was able to get a cake on short notice, but the only cake at the 
                bakery came with writing that said “I’m sorry I hit you with my car.” Laila called up everyone Electra knew and 
                made sure they could come over. Once everything was set in place, she invited Electra back into the house.
            </p>
            <p>
                At first, Electra didn’t know how to feel. She felt like she didn’t deserve this at all. Since she wasn’t 
                fully human she doesn’t get to have a birthday. But when she sat down, saw the presents, the cake, and got a 
                cheek kiss from her girlfriend Dodona, suddenly everything felt right. Even if she wasn’t fully human, she still 
                made an impact on everyone’s life and in turn, they also positively impacted her. Electra felt like she fully belonged,
                and that was the greatest feeling of accomplishment she ever felt.

                “<strong>Happy Birthday, Electra!</strong>” captures a moment in Electra’s life where she is treated like a living person. Despite being created over a year ago as a fully-fledged conscious being, her friends let the day of her creation act as a way to celebrate the human tradition. Amidst grappling whether or not she’s fully human, her friends help her escape for a moment and treat her like a true friend. 
                <br>
                This piece is meant to capture a sweet moment through silly fun. The main focus is on the characters in the center, but is also filled with playful and intricate details, such as a clown in the background or the cake saying “SORRY I HIT YOU WITH MY CAR.”
