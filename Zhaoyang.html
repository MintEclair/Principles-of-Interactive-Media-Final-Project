                Dude, it’s so easy to startle this guy it only gets funnier every time! For a while, Laila didn’t believe in the 
                paranormal and assumed Zhaoyang had an overactive imagination. Buuuuut then he got kidnapped by some evil ghost girl, 
                got sent to another dimension, and guess which gal had to go fight a ghost about it. Yeah, it was pretty fun except in 
                the beginning where I got my ASS KICKED!

                Okay, enough venting. He’s an alright dude, albeit he’s still very skittish, kinda lazy, and doesn’t have much of a 
                drive to do anything at all. However, he’s a really sweet and caring guy who wants to be there for his friends no 
                matter what. He’s been friends with Laila since they were in middle school and those two are inseparable. She’s got 
                weird robots, he’s got weird entities. Best friends for life! I was told though not to bring up the time they dated 
                in middle school. Ah shit, guess I admitted that, did I?
