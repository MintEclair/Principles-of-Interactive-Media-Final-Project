                So I guess you’re at the end now, huh? <br><br>

Rifled through what you wanted to? <br><br>

You know something?<br><br>

I don’t think you could do this with anyone else. Go through their memories, I mean. You could certainly ask them to share their stories and maybe you’ll get something that’s close to the truth. Human memory is super faulty after all. So even if you could, would those memories be the stone-cold objective truth?<br><br>

Personally, I don’t think I really care. Yes, I might have “super-intelligence” but my intelligence is basically like a fancy search engine. Yes, my memories might be the most accurate they can be, but if I feel like it I might add edits or other silly things to them to make ‘em even more special.<br><br>

I may not be a flesh and blood person, but my memories are important, all right? <br> 
I have people around me who love me and I love them. They don’t just see me as a robot. They see me as Electra Heart.<br>

And I can’t wait to keep making memories with them.
