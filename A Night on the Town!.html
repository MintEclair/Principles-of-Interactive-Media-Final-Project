                Electra and her friends often do something special once every three months called “Treat Yo Self” day. 
                Laila got the idea from one of her favorite shows, *The Office of Transportation*, and it’s been a staple in the whole group’s life. 
                The day began with them going out shopping and buying things not only for them but for each other as well. Since there was a school 
                dance happening in the evening, they all decided to go out and buy fancy new outfits for themselves to look great in.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before they headed out to the dance, of course, Laila needed a picture with everyone in it to not only celebrate another successful 
                “Treat Yo Self” day but also to celebrate the amazing friends she made over the past year.

                “Well, don’t we all look nice!” Electra pointed out as soon as everyone got together. <br>
                “All thanks to Ignacio over here! I admittedly don’t know anything about fashion…” Zhaoyang sheepishly said. <br>
                “Guess I really do have an eye for slaying!” Ignacio responded. <br>
                “Girl, OF COURSE you do! I mean you probably are slaying the hardest out of all of us, though. I love love LOVE your makeup!” 
                Dodona chimed in. <br>
                “Yeah, thanks for also doing all of our makeup, too, Ignacio!” Laila cheerfully exclaimed. <br>
                “Aww, glad you guys appreciate my work!” Ignacio shyly giggled. <br>
                “Okay, everyone! Let’s POSE!” Electra shouted.
            </p>
            <p>
                Laila set up the camera and immediately ran back to join the rest of the group. <br>
                “Uh..don’t know what to do. I never really take photos like this.” Zhaoyang admitted. <br>
                “Just do whatever!” Electra happily said as she made sure to get her posing right. <br>

                <p>
                    This digital print is an exploration of what the five main characters of <strong>Electric Heart</strong> would look like in different outfits for a fun night out together. 
                    <br>
                    Each character is dressed and posed in a way that best reflects their personality and main color scheme. 
                    <br>
                    In this collection, this piece represents a fun memory of going out with friends and learning the human tradition of having a fun night on the town. Everyone is breaking out of their shells to try something new and making Electra feel the most comfortable.
