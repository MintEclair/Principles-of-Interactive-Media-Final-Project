                Okay, uh…pretend that didn’t happen! Yeah, this is my girlfriend, Dodona. To be honest, 
                I still can’t fully grasp what her deal is but from what I can tell she’s not like anyone else. 
                Her eyes are always closed, but she says that she can still see out of the red gem on her forehead. 
                She has a fancy name and story for it but uh…I may have replaced those files with funny vines instead. 
                She’s like magical and junk, and her eyes look like mini galaxies! Ugh! I can’t help it she’s so pretty it makes 
                me want to shut down.

            <p>
                She’s a little aloof and kind of all over the place. I’m guessing that’s just what happens when you’ve been 
                around for oh, 200 years, I think? She talks a lot about old-timey stuff. I just can’t ask her what happened 
                in the 1920s cause then she gets sad and I HATE seeing her sad. But she’s still pretty cool with magic and has 
                saved my butt multiple times.
