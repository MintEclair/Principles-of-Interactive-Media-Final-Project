                Oh hey, look! This is me! Don’t I look super duper cool here? Yeah, posing with the gun and shit makes me look 
                so badass! And I’m not just saying that! Not gonna lie, I’ve done some awesome things. I’ve fought so many bad guys, 
                got a girlfriend, and even ice skated for the first time! Isn’t that awesome???
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope I can keep on being a baddie forever. I’d like to say I’ve grown and developed but I have no idea if 
                that’s true or not.
